# Grimm
__Grimm is a “boss fight” game. Grimm aims to make the player feel a sense of challenge and tension, requiring
the player to learn the flow and gain the mastery of the fight to win. You play as an 18th century monster
hunter, tasked with taking out a beast know as ‘The Raven’ in one on one combat. The game is aimed to those
who like a challenging experience in which you must fail to succeed.__
